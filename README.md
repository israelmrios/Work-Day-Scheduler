# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This application is a simple calendar that will allow you to add and save events per hour. Note, this is a work-day scheduler so you will be limited to standard business hours. It is very simple to see what time of day it is or any upcoming events since the calendar is color coded. This simple scheduler will also save to your local storage and not require you to login to any email provider. It is very simple to use and only requires you to click save.
